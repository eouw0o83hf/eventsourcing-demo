# Event Sourcing Demo #

This repo contains working code from a series of educational sessions about event sourcing.

## Concepts ##

Key concepts we're seeking to cover are:

* Domain modeling
* Creating business-level events
* Creating an aggregate

Upcoming concepts we may address are:

* CQRS (essentially command vs event)
* Event persistence 
* Event broadcast
* Projections
* Long-running transactions
* Sagas
* Advanced aggregate work
